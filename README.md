## Calculator

My task for this project was:
- Write a command line calculator application that has different settings, (b)asic, (a)dvanced, bmi calculator and trip calculator.
- The calculator will ask the user for which calculator they want to use.
- Then ask the user for the numbers to operate on.
- Then work out what to do with the numbers, depending on what operation they choose.
- Finally create a loop that loops continuously until they complete a single calculation.

Basic calculator functions:
- Addition
- Multiplication
- Division
- Subtraction
- Modulus

</br>
Advanced:
- Power
- Square root

</br>
BMI Calculator
- Calculate the BMI when given the height and weight
- the user is able to choose between the imperial and the metric system

</br>
Trip Calculator
- asks the user for four inputs:
  - distance
  - fuel efficiency (mpg)
  - cost per gallon
  - speed
- it will give you the time and price of your journey

Note: For every 1 MPH over 60 MPH, the MPG is reduced by 2
